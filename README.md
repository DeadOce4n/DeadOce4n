### Hi there, I'm Ivan Partida ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught software engineer* with a passion for type-safety and a love for DevOps.
Most of my work is hosted at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DeadOcean) because it's my favorite DevOps platform,
so make sure you go take a look to see what I'm working on!

If you wanna get in touch, you can find me on [X](https://twitter.com/DeadOce4n)
